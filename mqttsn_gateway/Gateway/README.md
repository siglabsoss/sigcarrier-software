MQTT-SN Gateway
======
This program is a Gateway over XBee and UDP.
Select from the network layer in lib/Defines.h, shown in below.

In case of UDP, Multicast is required for SEARCHGW and GWINFO messages.
Client multicasts the SEARCHGW to find the gateway.
Gateway multicasts the GWINFO from unicast port.
Client can get the gateway IP and port using std::recvfrom() functions.

If your client does not support SEARCHGW and GWINFO, you can skip the search gateway procedure.
You can CONNECT to a portNo specified with -u parameter and Gateway's IP address directly.

If you want to change to your own networkStack, i.e bluetooth, just modify the XXXXXXStack.cpp, .h
and lib/Defines.h, ClientRecv.cpp, ClientSend.cpp files.  Templates are built in already.

Supported functions
-------------------

*  QOS Level 0, 1 and 2
*  CONNECT, WILLTOPICREQ, WILLTOPIC, WILLMSGREQ, WILLMSG
*  REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, UNSUBSCRIBE, DISCONNECT
*  CONNACK, REGACK, SUBACK, PUBACK, PUBREL, PUBCOMP, UNSUBACK
*  ADVERTIZE, GWINFO


Usage
------
####1) Minimum requirements
*  Linux  ( Windows can not execute this program.)
*  pthread, rt liblaries to be linked.
*  In case of XBee, Three XBee S2 (one coordinator, one gateway and one client.)
*  or two XBee S1 (Digimesh, one for gateway and another for client)

####2) How to Build

    $ make

  Makefile is in Gateway directory.
  TomyGateway (Executable) is created in Build directory.

    $ make install
  TomyGateway is copied to the directory repo located.

    $ make clean
  remove the Build directory.

####3)  Start Gateway
  Prepare parameter file   /usr/local/etc/tomygateway/config/param.conf

    BrokerName=test.mosquitto.org
    BrokerPortNo=1883
    #LoginID=
    #Password=
    SerialDevice=/dev/ttyUSB0
    BroadcastIP=255.1.1.1
    GatewayPortNo=2000
    GatewayID=1
    KeepAlive=900

  Prepare Key files for semaphore and sheared memory.  file's contents is emply.

    /usr/local/etc/tomygateway/config/rbmutex.key
    /usr/local/etc/tomygateway/config/ringbuffer.key
    /usr/local/etc/tomygateway/config/semaphore.key

  Execute
        $ TomyGateway

Raspberry Pi SD card img file
----------------------

    1) Download from https://drive.google.com/a/tomy-tech.com/?tab=mo#folders/0ByWDD8Fur4QcMGpuRWd2RWVtMDA
    2) unzip and copy to SD card
    3) root's password is root
    4) Login ID is "gw" and password is "gw".    xxx.xxx... is IP address DHCP assigned.
        $ ssh xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -l gw -p 22022
    5) TomyGateway is invoked automaticaly.



How to connect XBee to Raspberry Pi
----------------------
    XBee Vcc ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin  1
    XBee Gnd ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin  6
    XBee RX  ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin  8
    XBee TX  ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin 10


How to connect Indicators and power off switch
----------------------
    Green LED   ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin 16  (Broker connected)
    RED   LED   ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin 18  (Broker disconnected)
    Blue  LED   ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin 22  (Sending/Receiving)
    PWR Off SW  ---> Raspberry Pi  Pin 11  (shutdown safely)
